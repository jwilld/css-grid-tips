            <h2>(grid-row:1;)(grid-column:2;)Grid/Flex Cheat Sheet</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='guide'>
            <p> (grid-row:2;)(grid-column:1;)Every element will say what position its at on the grid.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='guide-two'>
            <p> (grid-row:2)(grid-column:2) be sure to set the view hieght and width to 100 so
                that the grid takes up all of the space.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='guide-three'>
            <p>(grid-row:3;)Using repeat does exactly what it says. Repeats based on the first number and sizes based on
                the
                second.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='guide-four'>
            <p>(grid-row:3;)(grid-column:1;) so theres definitely a grid you can make within a grid ill do this on the left
                Honestly you can make as many smaller grids within a grid as you want.
                Make sure to use the correct sizing like width/height 100% so it takes up the space of the container
                it all depends on what you're trying to do.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='guide-five'>
            <p>(grid-row:3;)(grid-column:2/4;)
                So this starts at column 2 and ends at column 4
                Althought column 4 is non existant, saying its there
                basically makes it populate.
